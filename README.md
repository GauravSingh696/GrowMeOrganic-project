## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Server-Side Pagination**: Data is fetched from the server for each page, ensuring the application is fast and scalable, even with millions of records.
* **Persistent Row Selection**: Selections are remembered across all pages. You can select rows on page 1, navigate to page 5, select more rows, and the application will keep track of all of them.
* **Custom Selection Panel**: A dedicated panel shows a summary of all selected items from all pages, with the ability to deselect items directly from the panel.
* **Advanced Header Controls**: A custom table header allows for unique actions, such as selecting the top 'N' rows on the current page.
* **Horizontally Scrollable**: The table can be scrolled horizontally to view all columns without breaking the page layout, and the scrollbar is hidden for a cleaner look.
* **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Vite for a blazing-fast development experience, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
